# Simple Minesweeper

This game was inspired by the famous minesweeper game and was done in the context of learning javascript and the react framework in 2018.

## The rules
![initial](images/initial_grid.png)

Underneath each green square lies either a bomb or a point (1, 2 or 3). The pink squares indicate how many points and bombs are available in a given row or column.

Increasing the difficulty reduces the amount of points available in the grid. <br>

**The player loses when he/she selects a bomb.**

**And wins when he/she reaches 45 points**
