# Simple Minesweeper

This game was inspired by the famous minesweeper game and was done in the context of learning javascript and the react framework in 2018.

## The rules
Underneath each green square lies either a bomb or a point (1, 2 or 3). The pink squares indicate how many points and bombs are available in a given row or column.

Increasing the difficulty reduces the amount of points available in the grid. <br>
The goal is to reach 45 points.
